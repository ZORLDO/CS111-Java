   Problem Statement: Develop a calculator that separates change into quarters, dimes and nickels.
   
   
   
   Overall Plan:
   1. define variables needed
   2. take user submitted price and calculate change out of one dollar
   3. divide by 25 and subtract the amount out of the "change variable"
   4. repeat step three for dimes and nickels
   5. output the amount of quarters, dimes, and nickels the customer received back
   6. post a nice message to the customer
