   Problem Statement: Write a program that prompts the user to enter the distance to drive, the fuel efficiency of the car in mpg, and the price per gallon. Display the cost of the trip.
   
   
   
   Overall Plan:
   1. Write code to prompt the user for distance, mpg, and cost per gallon.
   2. Take the value of distance and divide it by miles per gallon, place answer in a new variable called gallonsNeeded
   3. Multiply the value of this new variable by the price per gallon of gas, this will be the total cost
   4. Round the total cost to two decimal places.
