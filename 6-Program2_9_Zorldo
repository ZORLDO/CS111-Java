   Problem Statement: Write a program that...

   - Reads a sentence from the user and effectively moves the first word of the string to the end.

   - Do not worry about punctuation marks, meaning if they are included by the user, just ignore them.

   - be sure to make the first character of the new last word lower case, and the first character of the new first word upper case.
   
   
   
   Overall Plan:
   1. Write code to prompt the user for a sentence.
   2. find where the first space in the sentence is
   3. Store whatever comes before this space in a variable.
      Assuming the sentence is formatted correctly by its author, whatever comes before the first space is our first word.      
   4. Separate the first letter of the second word and store that in a variable as well
   5. Use the toUpperCase method to capitalize the letter, store the output in a variable called "capitalized"
   6. Create a string that starts the sentence after the first letter of the second word.
   7. Use the toLowerCase method on the first word from earlier. Store this in a new string called lastWord (EDIT: add a space before that)
   8. Output the new sentence by printing.... firstLetter + newStart + lastWord
